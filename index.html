    <div class="text-container">
      <p id="text2" class="text-center collapsed-text">Stiaan - Where to begin... A story of pure love, I suppose. Not perfect, but pure
        and
        enduring. Though I care not for the casting of the reel, my princess surely enjoys the thrill of the catch, and
        that alone was reason enough—for her happiness is worth more than gold to me. Even though I was sick the entire
        day, it was worth it for the memory it gave us. For, in the end, it’s not about what you do but with whom you do
        it.<br><br>

        Then came the day—calm and nice. We spent it with my couch, and it ended with a bang. For the first
        time, we were honest, brave, and connected. We shared the horrors of the past. Though difficult and painful,
        some
        truths hurt, others saddened. It was a test to be foretold. Though I understand, sadness and sorrow cloud my
        mind.
        My past has come and gone, but my darling’s still remains—a shadow never fully absent. It’s a true challenge for
        a
        man, a knight of self-respect. Her shadow is not mine to fight nor to diminish with light. I fear its presence
        with unease, for this fight is not mine, and it breaks my heart. I am merely the side-line knight, supporting
        her
        with light.<br><br><br>

        Now I understand the cross she bears, and I long for the day it may clear—the day her heart is no longer
        coffined
        and hidden, but open and free to love and to feel. I yearn for the princess concealed, the one I have glimpsed
        through the misty blue of her eyes. Through the fog, I have only seen a wonderful, incredible princess waiting
        to
        come free.<br><br>

        My love stands strong, and I have no fear, for the Lord our God holds the keys. Together, we locked our future
        on
        the pier, placing it into His trusting, loving hands. We know our hearts are not pure, but as long as He remains
        our focus—our compass, our Father, our counselor—whether together or apart, whatever the future may hold, we
        need
        not worry. We need not fear, for He has a plan, and His will shall be done.<br>

        I love you more, and may nothing but God take down the tall stack of layers and layers of trust and love we
        share. I know
        it must hurt to see me struggle, but while you have learned to hide the pain deep down, for me, it is new and
        fresh—a new pain. For the love of my life is captive inside, and the shadow that follows like good friends do.
        Yet, I know the shadow doesn’t cast a cool, nice shade but blocks the view of the snake seeking shade. I wish I
        were better, but you know I try. Just stick with me and show me how, for you are a far better soul and spirit
        than
        I could ever be.<br><br>

        I Love you. I know but one thing and I know I choose to love you more every day And I pray that aseptically when
        its hard we'll choose to'love each other.  </p>

        beach
        to
        the first good night kiss you made everything feel complete. Starting our journey together by going to church
        made it
        all the more meaningful, like the perfect beginning to something
        extraordinary.</p>
